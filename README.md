# Sudoku_Research
This is a programming based Sudoku research project on analyzing the efficiency of various Sudoku solvers

Sudoku0 is the intuitive implementation of BackTracking Algorithm.

Sudoku1 is the advanced implementation of BackTracking Algorithm.

Sudoku2 is the implementation of DLX ( Dancing Links & X Algorithm). The basic set up of transforming from a Sudoku Grid to Exact Cover Problem complys with the paper by HARRYSSON, M., & LAESTANDER, H. (2014). Solving Sudoku efficiently with Dancing Links (Dissertation). Retrieved from http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-157551

Special Notice: 1. These files do not contain the processing from a file to a Sudoku puzzle. It still has the set up of the Sudoku puzzle, though.
                2. Sudoku 0 was the one I submitted to the final project of COMP 250 at McGill. By regulation, the file was pulled back.
